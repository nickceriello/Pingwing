# Pingwing
Simple ping script for IRC idling with Ircle

**Let it first be known:**
* I know nothing about Applescript.
* I know even less about IRC in general.
* I know even less than that about Ircle.

What we have here is a single file, it's Applescript and all it does is send a
ping to each server you are connected to every 15 seconds. This might be the
most boring thing I have done in a long time. The script supports up to 10
connections and appears to work fine on Mac OS9.

## Installation

Open up your script editor and paste the contents of the pingwing.scpt file in
there. You may have to adjust the script for your specific version of Ircle,
it's not complicated at all. Go ahead and save it to the Ircle scripts folder.
Start Ircle, under preferences on the scripts tab set your Pingwing script as
your startup script of choice. Uncheck the box to show the spinning beachball
for long running scripts. Save your preferences and restart Ircle.

That's it! You should see some fancy text in the console every 15 seconds as
pings ping things. Pingwings.
